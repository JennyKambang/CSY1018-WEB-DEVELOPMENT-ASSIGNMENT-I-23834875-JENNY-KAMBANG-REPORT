                <h3>Report Of My Portfolio Website-Making Journey</h3>
                <p>During the creation of my portfolio website, I went through many stages of emotions 
                as I faced both solutions and problems to my coding, designs, and debugging. Using the knowledge 
                I was given by my lecturer, I was able to understand how to do coding and with the help of design 
                templates done by the professionals, I was able to find the choice of my design for my website. 
                However, I faced many problems as I coded in both HTML and CSS. I faced my biggest problem Im my 
                tags in my HTML where I wasn't able to figure out why it was not working just to figure out that 
                the position as well as the right wording resulted in it working. I too faced problems in my CSS like 
                being unable to place my images in a grid format or a column format. Also, I had trouble applying  
                my work onto the Git Hub a lot of times as it resulted in me losing my codes where I had to re-do everything 
                by committing cleanly first. However, I was able to find my problems in the end and also learned better after 
                finding the solution. Being able to understand the basics made it much easier to understand and do up my 
                web designing however, I was able to also understand the importance of it as I created more and more lines of 
                error in my coding. Also, I learned creating a better design for one website would also mean a lot more extra 
                coding to do.</p>

                <h3>My Choices Of Design For My Website.</h3>
                <p>The design choices like font, color, and icons I have used for my website are simple and clean.
                    I took my choice of designs from websites like 'Google Fonts, 'Boxicons' and 'W3schools'.
